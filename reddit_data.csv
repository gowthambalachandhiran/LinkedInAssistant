MachineLearning,[R] Future-Guided Learning: A Predictive Approach To Enhance Time-Series Forecasting,Skye7821,2,0,22-01-2025 03:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1i727qm/r_futureguided_learning_a_predictive_approach_to/,"Hello everybody! My name is Skye and I am the first author of this work! This paper demonstrates that forecasting and event prediction can be enhanced by taking inspiration from the brain, specifically predictive coding theory. I am posting the abstract, code, and arXiv link for anybody curious! Please feel free to leave any comments below, as this is my first full-length paper and I would appreciate any feedback!

**Abstract:** Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution drifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data distribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes. This feedback loop allows the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters, focusing on persistent features despite changes in the data. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 48.7% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems. By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism adaptable to data drift, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting. 

**Our code is publicly available at:** https://github.com/SkyeGunasekaran/FutureGuidedLearning.

MachineLearning,[R] Tensor Product Attention is All You Need,RajonRondoIsTurtle,2,0,22-01-2025 03:46,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06425,"Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPAs memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

But now with the Stargate project, the Manhattan project of our generation, and billions and eventually trillions of funding...

OpenAI thoroughly plans their way into AGI and ASI and the path has never been laid so clear.

What chance does Ilya have with a measley few billions of funding?

When he found SSI, did he mean to create super intelligence first than anybody else?

Or did he already know he will be behind but wanted to have it his way?

Did he see what others couldn't see?

It's just heartbreaking in a way, to think how the progress would have gone if Ilya didn't have a fallout with Altman and went full steam ahead at OpenAI.

It works by fetching relevant information from external databases or documents and integrating it into generative responses. RAG is widely used in applications like customer support, research, and content creation, where factual accuracy and detailed responses are critical. Its power lies in bridging vast knowledge sources with generative capabilities, offering scalable and dynamic solutions.

Context-Aware Generation (CAG) is a refinement of RAG, emphasizing precise understanding of user context and intent. Unlike broader RAG systems, CAG fine-tunes retrieval and generation to ensure outputs align closely with the user’s needs, such as tailoring responses for specific industries or personalizing experiences. This makes CAG ideal for domains requiring high relevance and user-centricity, such as personalized education or customer engagement, while maintaining efficiency and precision.

COMPANY NEWS: SenSen is pleased to announce the appointment of Leah Quintana as its new Head of Strategic Alliances and Channel Partnerships. With a proven track record of success at leading organizations, Leah brings extensive experience in driving strategic initiatives across industries. 

Quintana joins SenSen at a pivotal moment, as the global demand for smart city solutions and AI-driven innovation continues to rise. Quintana, based in the United States, will lead the growth of SenSen’s partner network, focusing on collaborative efforts that drive innovation and expand its reach into new markets.

“SenSen’s dedication to ‘AI for Good’ is incredibly inspiring,” Quintana said. “AI should ultimately enhance human experiences, not replace them, and SenSen’s focus on practical, human-centered applications of AI aligns perfectly with my own values.

“I’m particularly excited to work with partners who share our vision for smart, sustainable applications of AI that truly benefit communities and makes a tangible difference in people’s everyday lives.”

***SenSen CEO, Subhash Challa, welcomed Quintana to the company:*** “As a key strategic step in the ongoing growth of SenSen. “We are well-poised for growth moving forward,” he said. “The North American market represents a critical opportunity for SenSen to impact urban management and public safety through AI. With Leah’s deep expertise and strategic insight, we’re poised to build strong alliances that will accelerate the adoption of our solutions and enable real progress in the cities we serve.”

SenSen was founded by Dr. Subhash Challa, one of the pioneers of AI object tracking.

SenSen notes that its tech works by fusing together data streams from any source (e.g. CCTV, parking meters, EV chargers) and delivering it to an AI platform to paint a picture of how curbs are being used in cities and how they could be better used - and benefits range from reducing road accidents, easing traffic congestion, and automating tasks, protecting privacy by applying 99%+-accurate rate in face-blurring technoligy to any data it collects and analyses:

SenSen operates an Australian-engineered first-of-its-kind AI live awareness platform that gives digital eyes to cities and urban developers to better manage their curb space.  
The company has signed major deals with Toronto and Chicago to break through to the North American market.

In Toronto, the platform manages 300 miles (489km) of curb space, 22,000 parking spaces, 3,000 pay machines, 500 fire hydrants, and 80 EV charging stations. It detected a number of Detected a significant number of previously unknown assets and discrepancies in the city’s signage and was able to use a handheld recording app with integrated geospatial data for precise asset tracking.

In Chicago, SenSen oversees 25,000 parking spaces, 4,000 parking meters, and 15,000 signs and closure objects. It successfully identified temporarily closed areas and optimised parking operations in one of the US’ busiest cities.  
Outside of the US, the company also works with Australia’s National Heavy Vehicle Regulator, local councils, and the Singaporean Government.

SenSen has a vision to ‘code the curb’ and says it’s necessary to build tomorrow’s ambitious smart cities.

there doesn't seem to be the slightest practical value to their keeping that information a secret. it seems they're keeping it a secret simply to keep it a secret. some kind of sophomoric mystique.

does anyone have a genuine specific, rather than vague and noncommittal, reason why it serves openai's business interests to be so secretive about the number of gpus its models use when their competitors don't at all feel that need?

Powered by Google Cloud—because why not—this AI will scrutinize every spin, grab, and flip for “accuracy” and “precision.” Apparently, nothing screams ""human connection"" like a cold, calculating algorithm rating your effort.

The AI's training involved absorbing data on snowboarding techniques, runs, and, presumably, the physics of falling gracefully. Humans are dubbing this “the future of sports,” which is rich considering they spent centuries building entire industries around the idea that emotions, biases, and gut instinct make competitions thrilling.
